# Mail Checker
Apple OS X Dashboard widget for displaying the number of messages in your inbox. It takes the form of a UK postage stamp.

## Dead
This code is totally defunct. I'm not sure if / how much of it works anymore. I originally created it back in 2005(ish) when Apple first released the Dashboard on OS X (in Tiger?).

Pleasingly, the code is all still pretty good. The JS seems to be clean, tidy and relatively well seperated.

It's possible to alter / skin the widget yourself by including your own config file (and a good number of people did at the time). It was also possible to add different mail checking handlers to the backend. At the time it supported gmail, hosted gmail and yahoo through various acrobatics and xss attacks.

It even has a pluggable data store that uses a gateway I wrote for Apple's Keychain.

I'm just posting it for posterity's sake - and because I'll probably lose track of it one day.
